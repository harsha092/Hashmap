<h1><abbr>ANDAMAN AND NICOBAR ISLANDS</abbr></h1>

    <P><strong>What is the best time to visit Andaman?</strong>
        <BR> The best time to visit Andaman & Nicobar Islands is between October and March as the weather stays dry on most days and it's not too hot. The days are bright and quite pleasant for a great vacation. It's the perfect time for diving and water
        sports or just lazying around on the gorgeous beaches.
        <BR> Monsoons (July to September) are not always recommended as the waves could be unpredictable and specific regions also receive heavy downpours. During the monsoon season or on days when it rains heavily, the ferry schedule gets disturbed with
        big delays and even cancellations. Water sports on beaches are also not available and if you're planning to dive or snorkel, visibility in the water diminishes during the rainy season.</P>

    British-era, this jail today pays tribute and stands in memory of the Indian freedom fighters who spent their exile there. Go soak in some tales of bygone days from the locals; you will surely hear an interesting story or two. Undoubtedly, you will
    come back mellowed and with an enlightened mind. There are also Hindi and English sound & light shows held here every evening, a Martyr's memorial, a museum, a photo gallery and an art gallery.

    the myriad masterpieces made of Andaman wood, or indulge in some forest related activities through scale models at the museum. There's also a large bomb crater from WWII alongside the forest museum. If you are in the mood to shop, Sagarika Emporium
    is a great place to start.

    breathing techniques involved. What's more, you don't need to have any swimming skills to indulge in this delightful activity, and it's safe to enjoy for 7 to 70 year olds alike! The full-face window in the sea walker helmet offers close up views
