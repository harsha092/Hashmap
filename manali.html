    <h1>Manali</h1>
    <p>One of the most popular hill stations in Himachal, Manali offers the most magnificent views of the Pir Panjal and the Dhauladhar ranges covered with snow for most parts of the year. With the Covid-19 pandemic going on, Manali has evolved to be a place
        loved by young people looking for longer stays for workation. With ambient cafes, good wifi availability, small eateries and convenient shops, Old Manali is among the favorite neighbourhood for such people. There are many homestays and hostels
        offering dorm beds for cheap for longer durations. Manali has many trekking options around it, making it a great base for exploring this side of Himalayas. River Beas provides great rafting options in the nearby town of Kullu. Adjoining Parvati
        river, lies the Parvati Valley with Kasol, Manikaran, Tosh and small villages attracting travellers for longer stays. Atal Tunnel now allows travellers to reach Sissu within a few hours making Spiti way more accessible. It snows the most in the
        months of January & February followed by December and March. If you're very lucky, you might find some snow in April. Tourists flock to Rohtang Pass & Solang valley for various adventure activities including skiing, paragliding, horse-riding &
        zorbing. Rohtang Pass is almost always covered with snow and can often get overcrowded and see traffic jams.

    </p>
    <h2>Tourism In Manali</h2>
    <p>Once called the "end of the habitable world," Manali is an important hill station of northern India and is the destination of thousands of tourists every year. Its cool atmosphereprovides a perfect haven for the ones afflicted by the hot Indian summers.
        Besides offering quite a few places for sightseeing, Manali is also famous for adventure sports like skiing, hiking, mountaineering, paragliding, rafting, trekking, kayaking, and mountain biking. In brief, Manali-the veritable "valley of the Gods"-is
        an ideal place for the ones in search of both adventure and comfort. The Kulluis in brightly patterned puttoos, Tibetan women wearing ankle-length rainbow-striped pinafores, Nepali porters, Buddhist monks, and even the odd party of Zanskaris,
        swathed in fusty woolen gonchas, muddled together with souvenir-hunting Indian and Western tourists-all add up to the welcoming hubbub of Manali.
    </p>
    <h2>Location</h2>
    <p>Situated in the central parts of the northern state of Himachal Pradesh, Manali is at the head of the Kullu valley, 280 km north of the state capital Shimla and 108 km from Mandi. Manali is perched at an altitude of 2050 meters above sea level and
        is spread along the banks of the river Beas. In winters, the temperature can drop below freezing point when heavy woolens are required. Summer temperatures are mild and light woolens/cottons are recommended. In Manali, one can find high mountains
        shrouded by silent snows and deep boulder strewn gorges. There are thick forests, filled with cool breezes and bird song. There are fields of wild flowers, small picturesque hamlets and fruit-laden orchards, especially apples.</p>
    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>Manali has a pre-historic legend behind its name. Vaivasvata, the seventh incarnation of Manu, the first creation according to Hindu mythology, found a tiny fish in his bathing water. The fish told him to look after it with devotion, for one day it
        would do him a great service. The seventh Manu cared for the fish until it grew so huge that he released it into the sea. Before departing, the fish warned Manu of an impending deluge when the entire world would be submerged and bade him to build
        a seaworthy ark. When the flood came, Matsya (fish), the first avatar of Lord Vishnu, towed Vaivasvata and the Seven Sages to safety. As the waters subsided, the seventh Manu's ark came to rest on a hillside and the place was named Manali after
        him.

    <h2>Best Time To Visit</h2>

    <p>The very well-known hill station of Manali is charming all around the year. While summers bring respite from the heated plains of the country, the winters cover the place with a sheet of white snow, making it all the more stunning. One can partake
        in sightseeing and adventure sports like river rafting, paragliding, zip lining and zorbing in summers, the winters are ideal for enjoying snowfall and snow sports in Manali. It is advisable to avoid the rainy season (July-August) because of landslides.

    </p>

    <p>From September to February, the temperatures might go down to minus 1 degree Celsius and the weather is amazingly cold. In December and January, the place is entirely covered in snow. It is time for snow sports like skiing, snow scooter ride etc.
        March to June are summer months where the temperature is pleasant, varying between 10 degree C to 25 degree C. During this time, sightseeing, adventure activities at Solang Valley and Rohtang Pass (closed in winter months due to snow on roads)
        are a must.</p>
