    <h1><abbr> NEW DELHI</abbr></h1>
    <p>Modern Delhi, popularly known as Lutyens' Delhi, bears a striking contrast to Old Delhi with respect to architecture, building materials and layout. However, Modern Delhi itself dates back to over a century when the British shifted their capital from
        Calcutta to Delhi. New Delhi, as it is known today, designed by Lutyens, has wide-open lanes, avenues and buildings that are worth traveling across the globe for.
        <BR> Just a century ago, the British moved the seat of their empire from Kolkata to Delhi. And it has been the Capital of India ever since. Now a thriving, cosmopolitan metro, the city has much to celebrate as it has already reached the milestone
        of completing 100 years as a Capital. With a history that goes back many centuries, Delhi showcases an ancient culture and a rapidly modernising country. Dotted with monuments there is much to discover here. The seat of many powerful empires in
        the past, its long history can be traced in its many carefully-preserved monuments, ancient forts and tombs.
        <BR>
        <br> All this is combined with the best features of a modern city such as a metro system, bustling markets and fabulous eating places. The past and the present meld seamlessly together, making centuries-old monuments a part of the city's daily
        life. Delhi is very much a history's child. The story of the city is as old as the epic Mahabharata, when the town was known as Indraprastha, where Pandavas used to live. Over the centuries, eight more cities came alive adjacent to Indraprastha:
        Lal Kot, Siri, Dinpanah, Quila Rai Pithora, Ferozabad, Jahanpanah, Tughlakabad and Shahjahanabad. Many empires rose to the heights of their power and were destroyed here. Among the prominent dynasties which made Delhi their capital were the Tughlaqs,
        the Khiljis and the Mughals.

        <BR> Even today, one can have a fascinating glimpse into the past in Old Delhi, with its labyrinth of narrow lanes, old havelis, and colourful bazaars. Rickshaws wind their way through this crowded, bustling capital of the Mughals, where life continues,
        much as it did hundreds of years ago. It is home to three World Heritage monuments—Qutub Minar, Red Fort and Humayun's Tomb that have survived many centuries, and give an idea of architectural wonders created by emperors in the past. Central Delhi,
        with its tree-lined avenues, imposing structures and buildings such as the Rashtrapati Bhavan, Parliament House and India Gate, reflect Delhi's colonial past. A number of museums provide a glimpse into the country's fascinating history.


        <BR> But the modern Delhi has a lot more to offer. Delhi has a modern, well-planned and extensive Metro network that connects all corners of Delhi; this network is still growing. New roadways and flyovershave improved connectivity, the latest of which
        is the Signature Bridge, an ambitious project of Delhi Tourism, which is under construction at Wazirabad – it promises to be a landmark.

        <BR> New malls and entertainment centres jostle for space with a growing number of brand new hospitals, residential complexes, and sporting facilities. Delhi is now a dream destination for those seeking expert medical attention and superior OPD and
        IPD facilities. Thanks to the advent of the Commonwealth Games, there are world-class stadia like the revamped Nehru Stadium that can be accessed by one and all, throughout the year. All of this has been developed and sustained while maintaining
        Delhi's green cover, a unique feature that distinguishes this truly global metropolis from other cities in the world where the tree line is subdued by skyscrapers.

        <h3>MORE ABOUT DELHI</h3>
        Besides the Metro, which connects all of Delhi's landmarks to the city centre as well as most suburbs, the new, a fun way to explore Delhi is by booking a HOHO bus tour. Hop on- Hop off buses, better known as HO – HOs, have been introduced by Delhi Tourism
        for visitors who wish to tour the city in a single day. With so many transport options, visitors now have the ability to go wherever they want – and there are a lot of places to see and a lot of things to do here. There are the age old-yet-perfectly
        preserved, sprawling heritage complexes featuring architecture from the Mughal and Tughlaq periods.


        <BR> The revamped Indira Gandhi International airport, now Terminal 3, provides visitors with their first experience of a modern, world-class city which is keeping pace with the best in the world. Terminal 3, from where international and many domestic
        carriers operate, has facilities which are on par with the world's most modern airports. The Airport Metro Express, which takes one to the rail station in the heart of the city, in just 17 minutes, provides easy connectivity for visitors. Whether
        you are travelling to Old Delhi, to Connaught Place or to Dilli Haat, the metro provides an easy way of getting around the city. The numerous flyovers, wide roads and bus and auto services also ensure that it is easy to explore the city.


        <BR> New additions to the city, such as Akshardham Temple and also the Lotus Temple are also great places to visit and give an idea of its multi-faceted culture. Delhi is also gaining recognition as a cultural destination. Delhi Tourism's major festivals—namely,
        the International Kite Festival, Magic Festival, Itra and Sugandhi Mela, Mango Festival, Dilli ke Pakwaan, and Garden Tourism Festival are becoming an integral part of Delhi's cultural heritage.


        <BR> No visit to Delhi is complete without an experience of its famed specialties such as its delicious curries, barbecued tikkas and kebabs. It is also a shoppers' haven, whether you want to pick up some rich, woven silks, handicrafts, or ethnic
        cushions for your home. For cuisine of different Indian states and an array of Indian art and craft there are three Dilli Haats in Delhi at INA, Pitampura and the brand new Dilli Haat at Janakpuri.

        <BR> It is time to celebrate this city which is a symbol of the country's rich past and thriving present. As a Capital city it is fittingly a window to the country. So come and look out of the window and discover a whole new city of numerous stories
        and experiences.

    <h2> Best Things To Do In Delhi in 2021</h2>

    <b> 1. VISIT INDIA GATE</b><br>
    <div class="div">
        <img src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcS3GZOxFJ-RMccD-YQn_c8EhRH4f6SRjAI_tA&usqp=CAU" height="200px" width="300px">
    </div>
    India Gate, one of the most popular Indian monuments and one of the first stops on most traveler itineraries, is famous for its majestic structure, beautiful fountains that have been carved in sandstone, and plush lawns. The gate was built by Lutyens
    to commemorate the thousands of Indian soldiers who died during World War I and during the Afghan war. The names of each soldier has been inscribed on its walls and an eternal flame burns below the gate ever since 1971. An ideal time to visit the
    India Gate is during the evening, once the structure is bathing in the surrounding lights. <br>

    <br><br><br><br>

    <b>2. DO NOT MISS THE LOTUS TEMPLE</b>
    <div class="div">
        <img src="https://d3hne3c382ip58.cloudfront.net/files/uploads/bookmundi/resized/cms/things-to-do-in-delhi-lotus-temple-1541409209-735X412.jpg" height="200px" width="300px">
    </div>
    The Lotus Temple, a sanctuary for those looking for some peace and quiet, is considered to be one of the most recognizable landmarks in Delhi because of its unique architecture. The temple has been designed to resemble the shape of a lotus, with 27 petals
    created out of marble. The temple might be dedicated to the Bahá'í people, but people from all sorts of religious backgrounds come here for worship. Don't forget to leave your shoes in the shoe room before entering the temple and spend some time in
    its beautifully manicured gardens.
    <br>
    <br><br><br>

    <b>3. RELAX AT LODI GARDENS</b>
    <div class="div">
        <img src="https://d3hne3c382ip58.cloudfront.net/files/uploads/bookmundi/resized/cms/things-to-do-lodi-garden-1541410157-735X412.jpg" height="200px" width="300px">
    </div>
    This enchanting park is considered to be one of the most favorite hangouts in Delhi. From power yielding politicians to ardent teenagers, you can find all sorts of people at the Lodi Gardens. The gardens were created to host the tombs of Lodi and Sayyid
    rulers, but are mostly famous as a much needed respite of green in an oasis of concrete. The tombs of Sikander Lodi and Mohammed Shah are also known to be worth a watch. There's an ancient eight piered bridge known as the Athpula which dates back
    to the time of Emperor Akbar as well.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br><br>
    <b>4. SPEND SOME TIME AT HUMAYUN'S TOMB
                                </b>
    <div class="div">
        <img src="https://d3hne3c382ip58.cloudfront.net/files/uploads/bookmundi/resized/cms/india-humayun-tomb-1537257833-735X412.jpg" height="200px" width="300px">
    </div>
    Humayun's Tomb is famous as the most captivating and perfectly proportioned mausoleum in Delhi. The tomb has been built in such a way that it seems to float over the lush gardens that surround it. Designed for the Mughal emperor Humayun, the structure
    is known to date back to the mid-16th century. It features Mughal and Persian elements and is totally worth a visit. The entire complex follows the rules of Islamic geometry and special emphasis has been provided to the number 8. To the right of the
    complex, you can also find the Isa Khan tomb, which is considered to be one of the best examples of Lodi-era architecture.

    <br>
    <br><br><br>
    <b>5. TRY LOCAL FOOD</b>
    <div class="div">
        <img src="https://d3hne3c382ip58.cloudfront.net/files/uploads/bookmundi/resized/cms/things-to-do-in-delhi-street-food-1541411654-356X199.jpg" height="200px" width="300px">
    </div>
    Food is a big part of Indian culture, and the best place to explore it is Delhi. From cheap eats costing next to nothing, right up to extravagant meals in (relatively) expensive restaurants, Delhi plates up almost everything. Try popular street food like
    golgappa, chat, and pav bhaji, and full traditional thali — a tray of food including bread, rice and several accompaniments. When it comes to street food, there is no need to avoid it entirely but be sensible about hygiene and be wary of anything
    that has clearly been sitting around uncovered for long periods. If you are not sure where to go, we highly recommend a dinner at Karim's Restaurant, a place that was once responsible for producing royal cooks for the Mughal rulers, and try out dishes
    such as chicken korma, mutton burraand seekh kababs.
    <br>
    <br>6. BE AWE-INSPIRED IN AKSHARDHAM TEMPLE<br><br>
    <b></b>
    <div class="div">
        <img src="https://d3hne3c382ip58.cloudfront.net/files/uploads/bookmundi/resized/cms/things-to-do-in-akshardham-1541410949-735X412.jpg" height="200px" width="300px">
    </div>
    A relatively new addition to the capital's collection of monumental architecture, the Akshardham Temple, consecrated in 2005, is recognised by the Guinness Book of World Records as the 'largest comprehensive Hindu temple' in the world. Consisting of intricately-decorated
    central temple building — the Akshardham Mandir, as well as exhibition halls, a water fountain and an expanse of ornate gardens, the complex took 11,000 artisans five years to construct, and it is estimated that 70% of all tourists to Delhi now visit
    the site. The Akshardham Temple showcases 10,000 years of Indian culture and proudly represents the country's rich architectural heritage and profound spirituality. Since its opening, it has quickly established itself as one of Delhi's most unmissable
    sights.
    <br>
    <br><br><br>
    <b>7. EXPLORE THE RED FORT</b>
    <div class="div">
        <img src="https://d3hne3c382ip58.cloudfront.net/files/uploads/bookmundi/resized/cms/india-red-fort-1537258223-735X412.jpg" height="200px" width="300px">
    </div>

    <br>The Red Fort of Delhi, or Lal Qila, is a Mughal fortress which surrounds an ancient city. Tourists are allowed to view its ancient mosques, architecture, halls and structures and discover the rich history associated with the Mughal-era Delhi.
    This massive fort might be a shadow of its former self, but it is still known to evoke feelings of splendor and remind visitors of the grandeur of this historic Delhi. Although most of the precious stones and gold that once decorated this fort were
    cleared out by its conquerors, the fascinating architecture still manages to make the fort stand out among the countless historic wonders located all over the Indian capital.
