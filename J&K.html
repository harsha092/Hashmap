        Empire.
    </p>
    <p>Jammu & Kashmir is a newly created Union Territory in India consisting of two divisions: Jammu Division & Kashmir Division, both of which are administered by the Central Government of India. It is located to the north of Himachal Pradesh & Punjab
        and to the west of Ladakh. Jammu is known as the City of Temples & offers plentiful sightseeing opportunities with its gardens, palaces, forts & religious attractions, the most famous of which is Mata Vaishno Devi in Katra. Kashmir Valley is famous

        the Partition of India & its political integration, Hari Singh, the Maharaja of Jammu & Kashmir, delayed his decision regarding integration with India.

    <p><span id="side">October to February: </span> While temperature begins to drop down in the month of October, November marks the onset of winter season. This also happens to be a perfect time to try adventure sports, sightseeing and other tourist activities.
        Chilly winds start sneaking in and at the end of December. While the maximum temperature during this season is 18 degree Celsius, the lowest can go below 4 degree Celsius on some days.</p>
    <p><span id="side">March to May: </span> While March is the spring time and you would see the greener side of the town in full bloom, temperatures begin to rise in April which also marks the beginning of summer season in Jammu. Baisakhi is also celebrated
        in the month of April and hence it is a good time to see the town in a festive colour. May and June are hottest and sometimes the temperature can rise above 45 degree Celsius.</p>
    <p><span id="side">June to September: </span> Jammu enjoys a good amount of rainfall. Although evenings turn cooler but the humidity and overall heat continues to remain the same. This is generally not considered an ideal time to visit the city as sightseeing
        and other tourist activities take a pause during rains.</p>
