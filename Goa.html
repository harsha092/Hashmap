    <h2 style=" font-size:40px; margin: 20px 0px;">GOA</h2>
    <p>For the history buffs, Old Goa is replete with many whitewashed churches, crumbling forts and spectacular mansions. The adventure junkies are also spoilt for choice in Goa with a number of watersports including snorkelling and jet skiing. The beautiful
        and quiet settings of Goa also make it a great destination for yoga and Ayurveda</p>
    <p>Goa has one of the best nightlife in India with trendy bars, beach shacks, elegant cafes and many clubs and discotheques. For those looking for a luxury stay, South Goa has many options.</p>
    <p>Known for its gorgeous beaches, stellar nightlife, delish seafood, world-heritage listed monuments, Goa is where all the fun is in India. Although the beaches of Goa are the primary tourism attractions, there are many surprises waiting to be unravelled.</p>
    <h3>History</h3>
    <p>Rock art engravings found in Goa are the earliest known traces of human life in India. Goa, situated within the Shimoga-Goa Greenstone Belt in the Western Ghats (an area composed of metavolcanics, iron formations and ferruginous quartzite), yields
        evidence for Acheulean occupation.Rock art engravings (petroglyphs) are present on laterite platforms and granite boulders in Usgalimal near the west flowing Kushavati river and in Kajur.</p>
    <p> In Kajur, the rock engravings of animals, tectiforms and other designs in granite have been associated with what is considered to be a megalithic stone circle with a round granite stone in the centre. Petroglyphs, cones, stone-axe, and choppers dating
        to 10,000 years ago have been found in various locations in Goa, including Kazur, Mauxim, and the Mandovi-Zuari basin. Evidence of Palaeolithic life is visible at Dabolim, Adkon, Shigao, Fatorpa, Arli, Maulinguinim, Diwar, Sanguem, Pilerne, and
        Aquem-Margaon. Difficulty in carbon dating the laterite rock compounds poses a problem for determining the exact time period.</p>
    <h3>Tourism in Goa</h3>
    <p>Tourism is its primary industry, and is generally focused on the coastal areas of Goa, with decreased tourist activity inland. Foreign tourists, mostly from Europe, arrive in Goa in winter, whilst the summer and monsoon seasons see many Indian tourists.
        Goa handled 2.29% of all foreign tourist arrivals in the country in 2011.This relatively small state is situated on the west coast of India, between the borders of Maharashtra and Karnataka, and is better known to the world as a former Portuguese
        enclave on Indian soil. Thus, Tourism forms the backbone of Goa's economy.Goa along with being a popular beach destination in India is a perfect honeymoon destination, a great getaway with friends, and an amazing family holiday place, which means,
        the place is filled with activities and attractions to keep all its visitors engaged.</p>

    <h3>Best time to Visit</h3>
    <p><span>Mid-November to Mid-February:</span> These are the best months to visit the party capital since the weather is pleasantly cool and comfortable. It's the perfect time to relax on the beaches amidst other tourists who make the most of these three
        months in Goa. December is the time when Goa witnesses one of its most popular festivals, Sunburn, besides extensive Christmas and New Year celebrations and is home to lakhs of visitors from across the world.</p>
    <p><span>March to May:</span> This is the season when the temperature rises, the sea becomes rougher and the weather turns hot and humid. Not many people visit Goa between the months of March and May since there are not many activities to indulge in.
        However, the prices of hotels and home stays become way too reasonable in case you want to visit Goa for a three-to-four day break with your beloved, looking for peace and calm.</p>
    <p> <span> Mid-June to October:</span> Mid-June to October is the time when the rains hit the beautiful Goa.If you love the monsoon and the lush green countryside that the rain Gods turn Goa into, July to September is a great time to visit. One of the
        reasons to visit Goa during monsoons is also due to the festival of Sao-Joao (the fertility feast of Saint John the Baptist) that is held during late June. It's an interesting event where men jump into wells that are overflowing to fetch bottles
        of the local alcohol called feni. You might get a good bargain at the hotels during this season.</p>
